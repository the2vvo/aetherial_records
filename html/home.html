					<h1>NEWS/PROJECT TITLE.AUTHORS.INFORMATION</h1>

					<h1>Feb 1 / 2016 - Grand Opening!</h1>

					<p>We are very excited to announce the opening of our record label / artist hub. We are very enthusiastic to start this adventure full of creativity and collaborations. We already have so many things planned for this year and we can't wait to start sharing them with you.</p>

					<p>One more thing - we have open spaces on our roster if you are an artist looking for a label. We are looking for experimental, electronic, electro-acoustic acts. We are open to non-music (visual, installation) artists too. If you are interested, drop us a message and we will get back to you to discuss the possibilities of working together.</p>

					<p>Also, if you wish to receive news about events, releases and other important matters, you can sign-up to our newsletter at the bottom of the page. We promise not to spam or disclose your email to anyone else. We are real people and we don't want to do anything to somebody that we'd hate to be done to us.</p>

					<p>So welcome to Aetherial and stay tuned.</p>
